# Coursera Capstone

## Summary

This repository contains the files for my capstone project to the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, offered on Coursera. For this project, we were to explore a dataset 
related to car accidents, and use the data to predict the severity of each accident. The dataset used for this project came from Kaggle, and was titled 
*US Accidents (3.5 million records)* by Sobhan Moosavi. The findings from my project were summarized in to a final report, which is also included.

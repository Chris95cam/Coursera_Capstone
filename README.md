# Coursera Capstone

## Summary

This repository contains the files for my capstone project to the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, offered on Coursera. For this project, we were to explore a dataset 
related to car accidents, and use the data to predict the severity of each accident. The dataset used for this project came from Kaggle, and was titled 
*US Accidents (3.5 million records)* by Sobhan Moosavi. The findings from my project were summarized in to a final report, which is also included.

## Contents

- [IBMDataScienceCapstone-CarAccidentSeverityClassification.ipynb](https://github.com/Chris95cam/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/IBMDataScienceCapstone-CarAccidentSeverityClassification.ipynb): Python notebook containing the data processing, data exploration, and model building for this project. 

- [placeholder](placeholder) - Report summarizing the findings of my project.

- [locationfetcher.py](https://github.com/Chris95cam/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/locationfetcher.py): Function I wrote that creates a csv file containing the longitudes and latitudes for each city in the dataset.

- [citylocs.csv](https://github.com/Chris95cam/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/citylocs.csv): csv file generated from [locationfetcher.py](https://github.com/Chris95cam/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/locationfetcher.py). The file contains the longitudes and latitudes for each city in the dataset.
